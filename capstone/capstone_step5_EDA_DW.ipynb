    "Here I will focus on my chosen dataset for the capstone project, using Exploratory Data Analysis methods and Data Wrangling techniques to prepare and better undersnat the data. The prior step of the capstone had me find a similar project, but there it appears all the data was already wrangled and cleaned (for the most part) by whoever is responsible for managing the city's data. Also the writers of the paper seem to have received quite a bit of guidance about how to create the features used in their model, so here I will have to determine all that myself.  "

    "## Dataset: Idle wells at risk of fees or penalties in California\n",
    "<p>To recap, in 2021, new legislation was passed in California that escalates the fines oil & gas operators must pay if they have not tested their idle wells according to the law. There is now a dramatic escalation of fees based on a schedule of the age of the well, and the duration of idleness.<br></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><b>Problem statement:</b> Given that not all the data is available to accurately determine the specific status of a well, I think we can using machine learning to assess the companies exposure to the risk: i.e. have they been addressing their idle well burden by plugging & abandoning their idle well fleets, or are they \"kicking the can down the road\", and postponing until max pain arrives.<br></p> \n",
    "\n",
    "<p><b>Hypothesis:</b> I think the larger companies (Chevron, Aera, SPR, CRC) are likely addressing their own idle well situations in a way to avoid onerous fees, and potentially damaging optics of not following the law. However, I suspect there a large number of smaller privately owned companies that have not kept up with their liabilities, and either don't have the cash flow to take care of it, or are hoping to fly under the radar for a bit longer.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><b>Data set:</b> the state publishes its view of the list of all wells in the state (241,912 data points, each of which represents a physical well), with currently known status and original drill (SPUD) date, so we know the age of the well, and the state's view of the status, which they have likely calculated based on the monthly production reports the operators are legally bound to send them. I have heard annecdotally it can take the state up to 2 years to update the well status, so there's some room here for machine learning to predict a trend by operator.</p>\n",
