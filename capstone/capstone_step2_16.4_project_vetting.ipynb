    "<H4>Candidate 1: Idle wells at risk of fees or penalties in California</H4>\n",
    "<p>In 2021, new legislation was passed in California that escalates the fines oil & gas operators must pay if they have not tested their idle wells according to the law. There is now a dramatic escalation of fees based on a schedule of the age of the well, and the duration of idleness.<br></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><b>Problem statement:</b> Given that not all the data is available to accurately determine the specific status of a well, I think we can using machine learning to assess the companies exposure to the risk: i.e. have they been addressing their idle well burden by plugging & abandoning their idle well fleets, or are they \"kicking the can down the road\", and postponing until max pain arrives.<br></p> \n",
    "\n",
    "<p><b>Hypothesis:</b> I think the larger companies (Chevron, Aera, SPR, CRC) are likely addressing their own idle well situations in a way to avoid onerous fees, and potentially damaging optics of not following the law. However, I suspect there a large number of smaller privately owned companies that have not kept up with their liabilities, and either don't have the cash flow to take care of it, or are hoping to fly under the radar for a bit longer.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><b>Data set:</b> the state publishes its view of the list of all wells in the state (241,912 data points, so I think it exceeds the recommended minimum 15k data samples), with currently known status and original drill (SPUD) date, so we know the age of the well, and the state's view of the status, which they have likely calculated based on the monthly production reports the operators are legally bound to send them. I have heard annecdotally it can take the state up to 2 years to update the well status, so there's some room here for machine learning to predict a trend by operator.</p>\n",

    "<H4>Candidate 2: Image recognition for pest control efforts\n",
    "<p>In my city we have a lot of issues with Norwegian roof rats in house attics. Using a 24/7 video surveillance system, it should be possible to use motion detection to grab still pictures for pest identification. I would use something like a VGG framework with transfer learning to differentiate pictures with and without pests. For example, local birds and squirrels would not be classified as pests, but mice and rats would be. In a real world application, the users would only be notified when a real pest is identified, not other animals (or shadows from trees/clouds/etc.)<br></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><b>Problem statement: </b> Many current services like Google Nest and Ring camera offer cloud-based services for motion detection and sending notifications if people are detected, but I haven't seen any popular services for pest control.<br></p> \n",
    "\n",
    "<p><b>Hypothesis: </b> Using pre-trained model frameworks, such as VGG16, it should be fairly straightforward to do some image analysis for a class of small animals such as rats, mice, racoons, squirrels, and determine frequency of visitation, and get pretty decent accuracy on pest or not pest classification.</p>\n",

    "<p><b>Data set: </b> Self provided still images from Nest Google camera captures vs. ImageNet trained VGG16 or similar framework.</p>\n",

    "<H4>Candidate 3: Impact of government subsidies on renewable energy deployment\n",
    "<p>In the US, and California in particular, there have been several rounds of subsidies over the years, both at the federal and state levels. With consumver solar deployment numbers, it should be possible to forecast the rate of solar (and maybe other renewable energy) adoption over time as a function of subsidies.<br></p>\n",

    "<p><b>Proposal: </b>Using publically available data, build a forecasting model that predicts the adoption of solar when government subsidies/incentives are in effect. This would show the rate of adoption in the future with and without subsidies.</p>\n",
